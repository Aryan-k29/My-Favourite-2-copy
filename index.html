        <h1>My Hobby <br> Reading Books</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Books are everywhere. Libraries big and small and bookstores are splattered all over college campuses and larger cities. They are all filled with one of the most important things of all time—books. Those who read books appreciate the multiple places to find books. Those who aren’t fans of books, don’t understand what could make readers want to obsess over books. There is a reason for their obsession, though. You hear it all the time: read every day. Though reading might seem like simple fun, it can be helping your body and mind without you even realising what is happening. Reading can be more important for these reasons and not just knowledge. For those who don’t enjoy reading, you might change your mind after hearing about the benefits. Can something so easy and fun as reading be so helpful in your life? Of course, it can! Reading can be a great benefit to you in many different ways—such as sharpening your mind, imagination, and writing skills. With so many advantages of reading, it should be an everyday occurrence to read at least a little something. I am 10 years old and I study in grade 5. I have read a lot of books and now I have a good knowledge about them. I read them when I come home and complete my homework. If you are of my age and want read books, you can read the Famous Five series they are the best ones. Books make us a sucessful person in our life.</p>
